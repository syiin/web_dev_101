1. Use numpy to test whether none of the elements of a given array is zero
1. Use numpy to create an array with the values 1, 7, 13, 105
1. Use numpy to create an array of 10 zeros,10 ones, 10 fives
1. Use numpy to create a 3x3 identity matrix
1. Use numpy to compute the inner product of two given vectors.
1. Use numpy to convert a given array into a list and then convert it into a list again.
1. Use numpy to get the minimum and maximum value of a given array along the second axis
1. Use numpy to compute the mean, standard deviation, and variance of a given array along the second axis.
