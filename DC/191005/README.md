# Introduction to JS

1. Setting up NodeJS:
   1.1 Computers only understand 1's and 0's - binary
   1.2 We create programming languages that are written in text that can be converted into 1's and 0's
   1.3 The converter that does this is either a compiler or an interpreter
   1.4 NodeJS is a runtime environment - it contains an interpreter for Javascript
   1.5 So, we before we get started with writing any code, we need to setup the interpreter on your computer
   so that you can actually run Javascript

2. Variables
   2.1 Variables are little stores of data that we give a name. The example below says create a variable called carWheels that is a number:
   `var carWheels = 4`
   2.2 Javascript has a few different types:
   2.3 `var`
   2.4 `let`
   2.5 `const`

3. Operators
   3.1 Operators are things that act on variables.
   3.2 Perhaps the simplest kinds are mathematical ones you learned in school: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`

4. Data structures
   4.1 These are intelligent ways of structuring data
   4.2 Arrays and hash maps are the most important ones

5. Logic  
   5.1 `if`, `else`, `while`...etc these are control flow statements
   5.2 These let us create intelligent dynamic behaviour in our logic that can change

6. Functions
   6.1 Functions let use reuse chunks of code
   6.2 For example, if we wanted to count 2^8, we don't have to type `2*2` 8 times.
