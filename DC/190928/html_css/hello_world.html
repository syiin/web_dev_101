    <h1>Introducing CSS</h1>
    Where HTML describes structure, CSS describes style. It is about making
    things look pretty. Notice how we use the structure described in HTML to
    tell the browser what parts of our site should have what style (eg. h1
    should be red in colour, body text should have the verdana font)
