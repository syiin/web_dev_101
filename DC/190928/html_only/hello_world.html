    <h1>This is a h1 header: speaks for itself, this is a title of sorts</h1>
    <h2>This is a h2 header: this is a subheader beneath a h1 header</h2>
    <h2>This is another subheader</h2>

      <li>UL stands for UNORDERED LIST</li>
      <li>LI is a list item</li>
      <li>Notice these are bullet points</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>This is an ordered list. Hence, OL</li>
      <li>Notice how these have numbers</li>
      <li>To denote order</li>
